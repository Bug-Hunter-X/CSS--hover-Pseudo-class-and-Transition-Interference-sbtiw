The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error involving unexpected behavior with the `:hover` pseudo-class when combined with transitions and nested elements.

```css
.container {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
}

.container:hover {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.inner {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

.container:hover .inner {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

The expected behavior is that when the mouse hovers over `.container`, both `.container` and `.inner` change their background color. However, in some browsers or scenarios, the transition on `.container` might interfere with the immediate color change of `.inner`, leading to a jarring visual effect or even a momentary delay before `.inner` updates its color.
